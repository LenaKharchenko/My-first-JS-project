# My-first-JS-project

The user selects three random points in the client area of the browser.
On the basis of these three points two figures are constructed: a blue parallelogram, with three vertices at selected points, and a yellow circle, with the same area and center of mass as the parallelogram. 
The program builds red circles for each selected point and for 4th calculated point.
The coordinates of the selected points and the area of the figures are presented to the user numerically.
The user has the ability to freely move points in the screen area at any time. Moving points changes the image of the parallelogram and the circle, and displays the updated shapes.

The "reset" function clears the area and allows the user to select three new points.
The "about" function indicates information about the program.
